# 🚀 101 Coding Interview Patterns

This repository contains my personal solutions to the **101 Essential Coding Interview Problems** categorized by patterns, as featured in the [ByteByteGo Coding Interview Patterns](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/coding-interview-patterns) curriculum.

The goal is to move beyond memorizing solutions and instead master the underlying patterns that solve entire classes of problems.
